## Abstract

This project presents a comprehensive system for generating and evaluating handwritten digit images using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Leveraging the MNIST dataset, the system employs a cGAN to synthesize digit images conditioned on specified labels and utilizes a trained CNN classifier to evaluate and select the most accurate representations from multiple generated samples. The integration of these components within a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) facilitates seamless image generation, evaluation, and management. This document elucidates the methodologies, system architecture, implementation details, and operational guidelines underpinning the project.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized the field of generative modeling by enabling the creation of highly realistic synthetic data. Conditional GANs (cGANs), a variant of GANs, introduce label conditioning, allowing for the generation of data samples corresponding to specific classes. This capability is particularly advantageous in applications requiring controlled data synthesis, such as generating handwritten digits for educational purposes or augmenting datasets for machine learning tasks.

The MNIST dataset, comprising 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), serves as an ideal benchmark for evaluating generative models due to its simplicity and widespread use. In this project, a cGAN is trained on the MNIST dataset to generate synthetic digit images conditioned on user-specified labels. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the generated images, a separate CNN classifier is trained to evaluate and select the best-performing images from multiple generations. The entire pipeline is encapsulated within a GUI, providing an accessible interface for users to generate, evaluate, and manage digit images.

## Methodology

### Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs)

A cGAN comprises two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator, trained simultaneously through adversarial processes. The generator synthesizes images conditioned on input labels, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated images against real samples. The conditioning mechanism in cGANs facilitates the generation of class-specific images, enhancing the controllability and relevance of the output.

#### Generator Architecture

The generator network takes a noise vector and a one-hot encoded label as inputs. The noise vector introduces stochasticity, enabling the generation of diverse images, while the label ensures the output corresponds to the desired digit class. The architecture typically consists of dense layers followed by transposed convolutional layers to upscale the input into a high-resolution image.

#### Discriminator Architecture

The discriminator network receives an image and its corresponding label as inputs. It outputs a probability indicating whether the image is real or synthetic. The discriminator employs convolutional layers to extract hierarchical features, facilitating accurate discrimination between real and generated images.

### Evaluation Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

To assess the quality of generated images, a CNN classifier is trained on the MNIST dataset. This classifier evaluates the generated images by predicting their digit labels and assigning confidence scores. By generating multiple samples and selecting the image with the highest confidence score, the system ensures the selection of the most accurate and realistic digit representation.

#### CNN Architecture

The CNN classifier comprises multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. The architecture is optimized for high accuracy in digit classification, making it suitable for evaluating the fidelity of generated images.

### System Integration and GUI

The system integrates the cGAN generator and CNN evaluator within a Tkinter-based GUI. Users can specify the desired digit, generate multiple image samples, and visualize the highest-scoring image based on the evaluator's assessment. The GUI also provides functionalities for saving generated images, enhancing usability and accessibility.

## System Architecture

### Code Optimization

The application employs batch processing for image generation and evaluation, significantly enhancing performance by reducing the computational overhead associated with individual image evaluations. Additionally, asynchronous processing via threading ensures that the GUI remains responsive during intensive computation tasks, providing a seamless user experience.

#### Batch Processing Implementation

The `generate_image` function is optimized to generate and evaluate images in batches, leveraging vectorized operations to expedite processing.

```python
def generate_image(generator, digit, evaluator, noise_dim=100, num_generations=5):
    # Batch generation and evaluation logic
    ...
```

#### Asynchronous Processing with Threads

The GUI operations responsible for image generation and evaluation are executed in separate threads, preventing the main thread from blocking and maintaining interface responsiveness.

```python
import threading

class CGANApp:
    ...
    def display_generated_image(self):
        # Launch image generation in a separate thread
        thread = threading.Thread(target=self.generate_and_display, args=(digit, num_generations))
        thread.start()
    ...
```

## Results

Upon executing the application, users can generate multiple instances of handwritten digits corresponding to the selected label. The CNN evaluator assesses each generated image, and the system displays the image with the highest confidence score, ensuring high-quality outputs. Below are sample outcomes:
